## Refactoring
When working with this code, I did the utmost to adhere to the **Scout Rule** â€” which says to always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

The outcome is a refactored code - it now follows semantic HTML elements, the page follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, there are accessible alt attributes, and all elements fall in sequential order.
