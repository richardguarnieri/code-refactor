# Code Refactor
ITESM Coding Boot Camp

## Horiseo
Horiseo is a marketing agency requiring a webpage to follow accessibility standards in order to optimize it for search engines

## Refactoring
The code was refactored, this means it now follows semantic HTML elements, the page follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, there are accessible alt attributes, and all elements fall in sequential order.
